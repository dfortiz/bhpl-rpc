== Description ==
Add a visual sliders to the product, and run a formule to calculate the price. You can use aritmetic operators and 2 tags. If you need improve or add new functionalities/variables/preview/fields, just contact me [Frank Ortiz](mailto:dfortiz@gmail.com)
This plugins add two sliders to easily calculate the products price using a simple logic:
The price_base is the price for the first square unit, and the remaining units will use the values by ranges
If the remaining units is between 1 and 20, then the total price is price_base + the remaining units * range1
If the remaining units is between 21 and 40, then the total price is price_base + the remaining units * range2
and the same logic for the range3, range4 and range5
